# EV Station Finder - Frontend
[EV Station Finder](https://ev-station-finder-frontend.herokuapp.com/) allows users to find the nearest charging station for their electric vehicle. And to help them prepare, users will also see a 10-hour forecast in the stationâ€™s page. 
The guest user is able to utilize EV Station Finder with ease. A guest user can provide a location in the following ways:

  - zip code
  - full address
  - city and state
    
Additionally, the guest user can create an account for some added features:
  - Save favorite stations for easy access
  - Get step-by-step directions to the station (coming soon)
